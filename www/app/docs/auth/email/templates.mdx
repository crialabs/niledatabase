## Available Templates

### Email invitation

Sent when a user is invited to join a tenant, or uses their email address as the sign in provider.

### Reset password

Sent when a user requests a password reset. This is automatically triggered with a `POST` request to `/api/auth/reset-password`

The `callbackURL` sent to the endpoint will be modified with the token in the **api_url** variable, or it will fall back to the `niledb-origin` header, which is automatically set via the JS SDK
