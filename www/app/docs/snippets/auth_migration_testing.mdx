We recommend you do thorough testing in a staging environment before migrating to production.

Before starting a migration, both in staging and in production, we recommend you create a few test users and organizations in your existing auth provider. 
Make sure you have a mix of email/password, passwordless and social providers users.

Then, after migrating to Nile Auth, test the following (both in test and in production):

- Sign up and sign in with email/password, passwordless and social providers.
- Sign in with email/password, passwordless and social providers.
- Sign out
- Reset password
- Email verification
- Validate that the users have access to the correct organizations.

It is also important to test **negative** flows. For example, trying to sign in with an invalid password, 
or an invalid email/password combination. You want to be sure that unauthorized users are not able to sign in.

Finally, use the ["Tenant and Users" page in Nile Console](/auth/dashboard/managing-tenants) to verify that the all the expected user data and 
metadata was migrated, and that the users have access to the correct organizations.
