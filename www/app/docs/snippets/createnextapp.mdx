<Step title="Run create-next-app">
This guide uses Next.js with App Router, Typescript and Tailwind CSS. If you have a different framework in mind, you can find additional guides under "Frameworks" 
in the sidebar. Initialize a new Next.js project with the following command and give it a name:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nile-app --yes
```
