## Theming

The <code>{component}</code> component is styled using tailwind. It can be customized using the `className` and `buttonText` props, 
or using Tailwind CSS theme variables. You can find more details and full examples in the [customization doc](/auth/components/customization).

In addition, the hooks documented for each component can be used if you'd like to use Nile Auth with your own components. 
If needed, you can peek at the [source code of the component](https://github.com/niledatabase/nile-js/tree/main/packages/react/src) and use it as a template to create your own component for maximum customization.
