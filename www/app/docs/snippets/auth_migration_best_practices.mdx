Here are some recommended practices for a smooth migration from Auth0 to Nile Auth:

1. **Staged Migration**: Consider migrating users in batches rather than all at once. 
Start with a small subset of non-critical users or test accounts. Monitor for issues and gather feedback before proceeding with larger groups.
This will allow you to test the migration and make sure it works as expected before migrating all users. The "fallback strategy" 
described in the migration steps can be used to support both Auth0 and Nile Auth during the migration.

2. **Communication Plan**: Notify users well in advance of the migration. Provide clear instructions for any actions they n
eed to take (like password resets). Set up support channels for users who encounter issues during the transition.

3. **Backup and Rollback Plan**: Keep backups of all Auth0 data before starting the migration. 
Maintain the Auth0 configuration until the migration is complete and verified. 
Have a clear rollback plan in case of critical issues.

4. **Monitoring and Validation**: Set up monitoring for authentication failures during and after migration. 
Implement logging to track successful and failed migrations. Validate user counts and access permissions after migration.
