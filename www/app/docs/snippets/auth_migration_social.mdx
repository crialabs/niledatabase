If you used social identity providers with {identity_provider}, you will need to configure the same providers in Nile Auth.

You can configure social providers by going to "Tenants and Users" page in [Nile Console](https://console.thenile.dev) 
and selecting the "Providers" tab. 

Simply click on the provider you want to configure and you'll see the provider configuration page.
All providers use OAuth, so you'll need to provide the OAuth client ID and secret. It is recommended to use the same client 
ID and secret as the one used in {identity_provider}. And to use the same redirect URI in the social provider configuration.

You can see more details on how to configure and use each provider in the [Single Sign-On](/auth/singlesignon/google) section of the documentation.
