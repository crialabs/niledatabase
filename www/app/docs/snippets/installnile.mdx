<Step>
Your application must expose API routes to handle authentication operations.

First, create a folder called `api` under the `app` folder and a folder called `[...nile]` under it:

```bash
mkdir -p app/api/\[...nile\]
```

Create following files handle the calls to your server, as well as expose the `nile` instance to your application:

`/api/[...nile]/nile.ts`
```typescript
import { Nile } from "@niledatabase/server";
export const nile = await Nile();
export const { handlers } = nile.api;
```

`/api/[...nile]/route.ts`
```typescript
import { handlers } from "./nile";
export const { POST, GET, DELETE, PUT } = handlers;
```
