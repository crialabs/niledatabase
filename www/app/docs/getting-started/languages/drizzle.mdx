In this tutorial, you will learn about Nile's tenant virtualization features, while building a backend service for a todo list application.
We'll use Drizzle as the ORM to interact with the database, OpenAI client to interact with AI models, Express as the web framework and NodeJS as the runtime.

We'll use Nile to provide us with virtual-tenant databases - isolating the tasks for each tenant, and we'll use the AI models to generate automated time estimates
for each task in the todo list. The estimates will be based on the task title, and estimates of similar tasks in the tenant's history.
This technique is known as [RAG architecture](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/ai-embeddings/rag).

## What's next?

This example is a good starting point for building your own application with Nile.

You have learned basic Nile, AI and RAG concepts and how to use them with Drizzle ORM.

You can learn more about Nile's tenant virtualization features in the following tutorials:

- [Tenant management](/docs/tenant-virtualization/tenant-management)
- [Tenant isolation](/docs/tenant-virtualization/tenant-isolation)

You can explore Nile's JS SDK in the [SDK reference](/docs/reference/sdk-reference).
