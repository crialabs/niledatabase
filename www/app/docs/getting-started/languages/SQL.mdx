## 1. Create a database

1. Sign up for an invite to [Nile](https://thenile.dev) if you don't have one already
2. You should see a welcome message. Click on "Lets get started"
   ![Nile welcome](/images/nile-welcome.png)
3. Give your workspace and database names, or you can accept the default auto-generated names. In order to complete this quickstart in a browser, make sure you select to ‚ÄúUse Token in Browser‚Äù.

## 2. Create a table

Lets imagine that we are building a todo list app that maintains task for each tenant/customer and also uses AI to predict the time required to complete the task.

Let us create our first table that has a tenant_id column and a vector :

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "todos" (
  "id" uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  "tenant_id" uuid,
  "title" varchar(256),
  "estimate" varchar(256),
  "embedding" vector(3),
  "complete" boolean,
  CONSTRAINT todos_pkey PRIMARY KEY("tenant_id","id")
);
```

You will see the new table in the panel on the left side of the screen, and you can expand it to view the columns. If you are in `psql`, you can do `\d todos` in order to view the schema.

See the `tenant_id` column? By specifying this column, You are making the table **tenant aware**. The rows in it will belong to specific tenants. If you leave it out, the table is considered shared, more on this later.
![Creating a table in Nile's admin dashboard](/images/gui-create-table.png)

## 3. Insert first tenant/customer

Nile ships with built-in tables, like `tenants` table that you used earlier. They are covered in more depth in our concepts documentation.

Meanwhile, lets insert a tenant into the built-in tenant table:

```sql
-- Creating the first tenant
insert into tenants (id, name) values ('d24419bf-6122-4879-afa5-1d9c1b051d72', 'my first customer');
select * from tenants;
```

## 4. Insert first todo task for the first tenant/customer with vector embeddings

Now, with the new tenant created, lets insert a record to the ‚Äútodos‚Äù table. For the first task, we simply retrieve the embedding and the estimate from the large language model using the title of the task.
Let us assume we got the embedding and the estimate from the model as [1,2,3] and 1h

```sql
-- adding a todo item for this tenant.

insert into todos (tenant_id, title, estimate, embedding, complete) values ('d24419bf-6122-4879-afa5-1d9c1b051d72', 'feed my cat', '1h', '[1,2,3]', false);

SELECT tenants.name, title, embedding, estimate, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

If all went well, you‚Äôll see the first todo of your first customer üèÜ

```
name                 title          embedding          estimate       complete
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my first customer    feed my cat     [1,2,3]             1h            false
```

## 5. Add another tenant/customer and the first todo task for it with vector embeddings

It is now time for our second customer and their todo item:

```sql
-- creating my second tenant
insert into tenants (id, name) values ('7e93c45f-fe65-4f26-8ab6-922850fa4c7a', 'second customer');
select * from tenants;
```

Insert the first todo item for this tenant/customer

```sql
-- a new todo item for our second tenant
insert into todos (tenant_id, title, estimate, embedding, complete) values ('7e93c45f-fe65-4f26-8ab6-922850fa4c7a', 'take out the trash', '2h', '[0.8,0.2,0.6]', false);

SELECT tenants.name, title, embedding, estimate, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

If all went well, you now see the todo items for both customers:

```
name                 title                 embedding              estimate       complete
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
my first customer    feed my cat           [1,2,3]                   1h             false
second customer   take out the trash       [0.8,0.2,0.6]             2h             false
```

## 6. Tenant isolation

Nile goes a step further and provides tenant isolation. You can set the session to a specific tenant, and every query that follows will only return data that belongs to this specific tenant.

Think of it as querying a virtual database dedicated to a tenant.

You can select a tenant either from the drop-down list next to the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è¬†button. Or by setting the session parameter in SQL.

```sql
-- set context to isolate query to a specific tenant DB
-- our example uses the second tenant here
set nile.tenant_id = '7e93c45f-fe65-4f26-8ab6-922850fa4c7a';

SELECT tenants.name, title, embedding, estimate, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

If all went well, you‚Äôll see the todo task for second customer‚Äù and not the first customer:

```
name                 title                 embedding         estimate       complete
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
second customer   take out the trash    [0.8,0.2,0.6]             2h             false
```

## 7. Inserting second todo item for the second customer using vector similarity and tenant isolation

The embedding for the new todo task is calculated first from the LLM (let's say this is [0.78,0.18,0.62]). We will get similar tasks for the second customer based on the new task's embedding.
Note that we don't need to specify the second customer in the query since the session is already pointing to the second customer's virtual DB.

```sql
-- Note the tenant context is already set to the second customer and the session points to that tenant's virtual DB

SELECT title, estimate FROM todos WHERE embedding <-> '[0.78,0.18,0.62]' < 1;
```

```
title               estimate
------------------------------
take out the trash    2h
```

We can now ask the LLM to estimate the time for the new task by providing the estimates for similar tasks for the second customer
Assume the LLM returned 1.5h.

We can now insert the new task for the second customer.

```sql
-- a new todo item for our second tenant
insert into todos (tenant_id, title, estimate, embedding, complete) values ('7e93c45f-fe65-4f26-8ab6-922850fa4c7a', 'clean the house', '1.5h', '[0.78,0.18,0.62]', false);

SELECT tenants.name, title, embedding, estimate, complete
FROM todos join tenants on tenants.id = todos.tenant_id;
```

Note that you only see the two tasks for the second customer. This is because the session is still pointing to the second customer's virtual DB.

```
name                 title                 embedding                 estimate       complete
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
second customer   take out the trash       [0.8,0.2,0.6]                2h             false
second customer   clean the house          [0.78,0.18,0.62]             2h             false
```
