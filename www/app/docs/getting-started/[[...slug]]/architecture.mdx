## Architecture - Built to be tenant-aware and for the cloud

Nile is taking a radical approach to building databases. Our core insight is that it is possible to push tenant awareness all the way to the page level in Postgres and design it for the cloud from first principles. This helps us to provide a comprehensive and flexible solution to all the tenant management problems for building and scaling SaaS.

We will have a more detailed write-up about our blueprint architecture, but here are the key highlights

- **Global routing gateway** that can enforce tenant data isolation at the session and connection level, route to the correct tenant, and provide a single database experience across all virtual tenant DBs
- **Database clustering technology** that helps place tenants on shared or dedicated Postgres compute anywhere globally and manage schemas migrations across tenants
- **Tenant-aware Postgres pages** that ensure pages are always isolated to a single tenant, which helps to move tenants instantaneously, generate backups per tenant/customer, fork the database with data of a specific customer for testing, and provide performance insights by tenants.
- **Storage and compute decoupling** to move tenant pages instantaneously across computes to provide instant capacity and manage performance guarantees for any tenants
- **Cloud-native architecture** by leveraging S3 for permanent storage and replication cross-region
