# Create User with a Tenant Association

Users are not nested under tenants; a single user may have access to multiple tenants. But this endpoint allows you to create a user with a tenant association in a single request.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <div>
    <p> Create a new user by providing an email address and password. The user will be associated with the tenant in the request path.  </p>
    <p> The response includes the user id and an access token for the user. The access token can be used to perform API operations on the user's behalf.  </p>
    </div>
