# API Reference

Hello Developer! Our REST API has been designed to provide you a secure, straightforward interface for interacting with Nile. We speak JSON, use standard HTTP verbs, return standard HTTP response codes, and strive for no surprises.

The root URL for all requests is whatever region your database is in, something like `https://eu-central-1.api.thenile.dev/databases/<database_id>/v2`. You can find this information in the `settings` page of your database at http://console.thenile.dev

Requests require that you to specify your database id in the URL path. For example:

```bash
https://eu-central-1.api.thenile.dev/databases/0190r542-ab89-7d4f-9a28-2ec89441e5fb
```

## Rate limiting

The API is currently subject to our terms of service. We may introduce rate limits in the future.

# User Authentication

User login and sign-up requests return an authentication token in two forms. For credentials (username/password), it come in the form of a [JWT](https://jwt.io/). For identity providers, it comes in the form of a session token that is contained in the `auth.sessions` table if the database. This token must be included in the `cookie` header with the key `nile.session-token` of all subsequent requests.
In addition, authentication requests are protected by a [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)

- For more details, see the [Create User](/docs/reference/api-reference/users/create-user) and [Login User](/docs/reference/api-reference/users/login-user) operations.
- Check out our [user management examples](https://github.com/niledatabase/niledatabase/tree/main/examples/user_management) to see usage in an application.
