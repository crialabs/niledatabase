# Founding Engineer - Auth

## What is Nile?

Nile is a Postgres backend to build, launch, and scale B2B applications. Nile re-engineers PostgreSQL for multi-tenant (B2B) apps, making it possible to launch and scale quickly, securely, and in the most cost-effective manner. Nile comes with batteries included like authentication, authorization and vector storage on top of Nile's Postgres to build world-class B2B apps quickly, securely and at scale with cost savings of 40% - 50%.

## What are we looking for?

We are looking to hire senior engineers with deep authentication and authorization experience willing to work in a seed-stage startup. You will work mainly on [Nile Auth](https://github.com/niledatabase/nile-auth), our open source Auth service that provides auth support for B2B apps.

A list of things we expect:

- Architect and develop world-class authentication technology and user management features on top of Postgres.
- Work on auth features like tenant and user management, SSO, SCIM, MFA, OIDC, SAML, RBAC, etc, on top of Nile Postgres.
- Experience building public SDKs and APIs and supporting users using them.
- Have a strong sense of how world-class auth solution looks like.
- Care deeply about developers and their experience on the platform.
- Work across the platform end to end to ship great features. You don't restrict yourself to a specific component and will make necessary changes to build a feature end-to-end.
- Have a founder's mindset when solving problems. This means what finally matters is that the developers who use the product are successful, which helps the company win.
- Strong sense of ownership. Think end-to-end and care about how the feature or product is delivered to the end user. Don't stop at just product development.
- Intense execution and the ability to deliver value incrementally. You will push for extended hours to build a world-class product.
- Provide support to run a world-class service and strive for an SLA of 99.95.
- Align with our values and hold everyone accountable to them.
- Work with a small team, collaborate, and stay committed to the mission.
- Previous experience with open source and developing Auth solutions is a huge plus.
- Strong knowledge in frontend and javascript frameworks. Expertise in other languages is a plus to support a client ecosystem in multiple languages.
- Ability to evangelize and be a strong proponent of the product in the community.

## The technology you would work on

- Typescript, Postgres, NextJS, Vue etc.
- Authentication and Authorization features to build highly secure service
- 100% open source technologies
- Linear, Notion, and Slack for collaboration

## Our values

Our values are how we operate every day. We hire, make decisions, and operate based on these values. We want to share this transparently to ensure candidates can self-select and evaluate if Nile will be a great place for them.

**Love Developers**

We have a maniacal focus on developer experience. We take great pride in ensuring developers love building their applications on Nile. Developers have a high bar, and we will strive to exceed their expectations every time. This is achieved by showing love, being honest, and taking great care to make the developer's life easy.

**Mission Driven**

Our mission is to enable developers to accelerate the next billion modern SaaS. We want to build the best platform on the planet that helps us to achieve our mission. This requires intense focus, and we cannot allow anything else to distract us. We will make incremental progress every day towards our mission.

**First Principles Thinking**

To build something truly groundbreaking, you need to break every past assumption about a problem and try to build solutions from first principles. The assumptions of the past may not hold in the new world. We must break down problems into their fundamental truths and build upon them. We challenge ourselves constantly to be first principles thinkers.

**Strive for World-Class**

We want to create a company that is among the best in the world. We believe that excellence can only be achieved by constantly pushing ourselves to meet high standards in everything we do. Even the smallest details are given immense attention and we work tirelessly to ensure that they are perfect. We know what greatness looks like and we are relentless in our pursuit of it.

**Intensely Execute and Iterate**

Iteration velocity has a significant impact. We move fast, build high-quality products, and iterate rapidly on user feedback. We will optimize for quick feedback loops and learn. We are not done when we ship v0. We persist in improving the experience and the value we deliver. Every next version we ship will make the product significantly better.
